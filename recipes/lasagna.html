    <h2>A homemade dish</h2>
    <p>This easy lasagna recipe is one my favorite comfort foods. Itâ€™s the best with multiple layers of noodles, sauce and cheese. For family get togethers, we love to serve it with a chopped salad and garlic bread to make the ultimate meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, Italian</li>
        <li>sausage, onion, and garlic. Cook until evenly brown. Drain grease.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread with half of the ricotta cheese mixture, then layer with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese, 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese, and 3 cups meat sauce. Repeat layers and top with remaining noodles and meat sauce. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
        <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
